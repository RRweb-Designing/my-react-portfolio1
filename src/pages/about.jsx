I embarked on my academic journey by earning a Bachelor's degree in [B.Com] in 2022. Currently, I am honing my skills and knowledge by pursuing a Post Graduate Diploma in Computer Applications (PGDCA) at Government Polytechnic Unnao. Beyond academics, my aspirations extend to the realm of entrepreneurship, where I am determined to carve a path as a successful businessman. </p>
